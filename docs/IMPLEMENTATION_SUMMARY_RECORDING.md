# Recording and Gallery Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive screen/AR session recording functionality with gallery integration to the Flutter AR app. The system captures rendered overlay content with device audio, manages storage permissions, and provides an intuitive user interface for recording management.

## Architecture

### Domain Layer
- **Recording Entity**: Core data model with properties for id, filePath, createdAt, duration, fileSize, audio status, and recording status
- **RecordingRepository Interface**: Abstract contract defining all recording operations
- **Use Cases**: 
  - StartRecordingUseCase: Initiates recording with optional audio
  - StopRecordingUseCase: Stops current recording
  - SaveToGalleryUseCase: Saves recording to device gallery
  - GetRecordingsUseCase: Retrieves and watches recording list

### Data Layer
- **RecordingService**: Core service handling platform channel communication, file management, and recording logic
- **RecordingRepositoryImpl**: Concrete implementation of repository interface
- **Platform Integration**: Android native code using MediaRecorder and MediaProjection APIs

### Presentation Layer
- **RecordingControls Widget**: UI component for start/stop recording with real-time feedback
- **RecordingGallery Widget**: Gallery view with grid layout for managing recordings
- **RecordingProvider**: Riverpod state management for recording operations
- **AR Page Integration**: Floating action button and overlay controls

## Key Features
