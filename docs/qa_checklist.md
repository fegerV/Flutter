4. Verify marker is detected
5. Verify video overlay appears
6. Move device and verify overlay follows marker

### Scenario 2: Multiple Markers
1. Set up multiple markers in view
2. Verify all markers are detected
3. Verify corresponding videos play
4. Occlude one marker and verify its video pauses
5. Reveal marker and verify video resumes
